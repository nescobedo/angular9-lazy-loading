<h1 align="center">Angular 9 LazyLoading Modules the Ivy way</h1>

I've been creating a lot of angular repos lately and was setting up lazy loading for a new app.  Should have been less then an hour to setup the modules and components I wanted but I kept getting errors when setting up child routes.  

In the end I forgot that I was using the latest and greatest (Ivy) and that the loadChildren process was changed.   

**Angular 8:**  
  loadChildren: '../app/orders/orders.module#OrdersModule',

**Angular 9:**  
 loadChildren: () => import('./orders/orders.module').then(m => m.OrdersModule)
